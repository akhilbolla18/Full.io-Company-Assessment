A) Reverse-i-search, often referred to as "reverse incremental search," is a feature in a Linux terminal that allows you to search for a previously entered command by typing a few characters of the command. As you type, the terminal displays the most recent command that matches the entered characters.

To perform a reverse-i-search:

1. Open your terminal.
2. Press `Ctrl` + `R`.
3. Start typing a few characters of the command you're looking for.
4. As you type, the terminal will display the most recent command that matches the entered characters.
5. You can keep typing or pressing `Ctrl` + `R` again to cycle through matching commands.

Once you find the desired command, you can press `Enter` to execute it, or you can modify the command before executing it. This search works in a reverse chronological order, so the most recent matching command will be displayed first.



B) In Linux, hidden directories are typically those whose names start with a dot (.). 
These directories are hidden by default when listing files and directories using standard commands like ls. 

To list out hidden directories using the Linux command line, 
you can use the following command:

ls -d .*/
